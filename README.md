## How to use it:

### Install all the dependencies
`npm install`

### Add your Azure AI api key and ednpoint
Include your Azure AI api key and endpoint inside .env with the variable name: 
`AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY="your_key_here"`
`AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT="your_endpoint_here"`

> [!WARNING]
> (For Judges) If you don't do that then the app will ask you to enter the api key and endpoint the first time you try to generate a post. The credentials you enter there are not stored permanently anywhere in the app and they are going to be available just while you have the page open. If you don't have a valid Azure OpeanAI apikey/endpoint and you are a judge, then send me an email to devbambinoacc@gmail.com and I would share my credentials with you.

### Run the app
`npm run dev`

### Testing product links and product images

## Troubleshooting

The feature generating a post from an url is doing web scraping to extract the text from the web page shared. If you are running the app in Localhost then a Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) issue would occur. To fix the issue you would need to use the Firefox web browser and install the extension [CORS Everywhere](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cors-everywhere/).
